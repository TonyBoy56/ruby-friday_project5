_This is a calculator that determines, based on one's age, their actual age on other planets. Among this interesting fact, it will also tell you your life expectancy on those planets, and whether or not you surpassed that value._

## SPEC Sheet

### _Calculations of a Younger Person:_
* A method which returns a human's age in Earth years:
   * Input: user's age (35).
   * Output: age in Earth years (35).

   * Input: user's age (90).
   * Output: age in Mars years (47).

* A method which returns a human's age in Jupiter years:
   * Input: user's age (90).
   * Output: age in Jupiter years (7).

* Determine the user's time lived passed LE on Earth.
   * Input: users age (90).
   * Output: number of years left (18).

* Determine the user's time lived passed LE on Venus.
   * Input: users age (90).
   * Output: number of years left ().

* Determine the user's time lived passed LE on Mercury.
   * Input: users age (90).
   * Output: number of years left ().

* Determine the user's time lived passed LE on Mars.
   * Input: users age (90).
   * Output: number of years left ().

* Determine the user's time lived passed LE on Jupiter.
   * Input: users age (90).
   * Output: number of years left ().

<!-- Continued Specs for an Ederly Person and Life-Expectncy methods will be done on Sunday morning. -->
